## Description Deliverable

### Elevator Pitch

Have you ever been struggling to create a custom creature for your Pathfinder Table Top RPG game? It's such a hassel to get out the rules, get some paper, and create a creature from scratch and can take so long. Wouldn't you rather be spending that time preparing other aspects of your next playsession? The Creature Generator streamlines this process so you can get back to the Pathfinder preping that you love the most! The Creature Generator will allow you to generate random creature stats or gives you the tools to make your own in minutes. All of your creations will be saved to a database so everytime you login, you can see the creatures you've created. You will also be able to publish your creature onto the forum page where you and your friends can share your creations and download them for yourself.

## JavaScript Deliverable

* Login - When you press enter or the login button it takes you to the User's Creature Database page. Saves user's username to the localstorage.
* Creature Creation - When you press the save button, it saves all of the informaiton on the creature and stores it into that specific user's database.
  * Saves all data written by the user. certain HTML fields are created when plus or minus buttons are clicked (saved to an array, pretty cool if you ask me).
* Userdatabase - users can see their saved creatures and click on the button to make a new creature. (clicking the navigation link to the creature creator works for this too).
  * Creature edit - users can edit their saved craetures and save them back to the database where the database will be updated (no duplicates).
  * creature delete - users can delete their creations from their database
  * Creature Upload - When you press the upload button, it uploads the save of that creature to the real time forum where a toast is then displayed of the user's username, creation name, and level of the creature.
