# Pathfinder Second Edition Creature Generator

## Description Deliverable

### Elevator Pitch

Have you ever been struggling to create a custom creature for your Pathfinder Table Top RPG game? It's such a hassel to get out the rules, get some paper, and create a creature from scratch and can take so long. Wouldn't you rather be spending that time preparing other aspects of your next playsession? The Creature Generator streamlines this process so you can get back to the Pathfinder preping that you love the most! The Creature Generator will allow you to generate random creature stats or gives you the tools to make your own in minutes. All of your creations will be saved to a database so everytime you login, you can see the creatures you've created. You will also be able to publish your creature onto the forum page where you and your friends can share your creations and download them for yourself.

## Service deliverable

For this deliverable I created an HTTP service to host my frontend and provide backend endpoints.

Node.js/Express HTTP service - done!
Static middleware for frontend - done!
Calls to third party endpoints - I didn't have time to implement this. ðŸ˜”
Backend service endpoints - Placeholders for login that stores the current user on the server. Endpoints for voting.
Frontend calls service endpoints - I did this use the fetch function.
